/**
 * gulpfile.js
 *
 * Rather than manage one giant configuration file responsible
 * for creating multiple tasks, each task has been broken out into
 * its own file in gulp/tasks. Any file in that folder gets automatically
 * required by the loop in ./gulp/index.js (required below).
 *
 * To add a new task, simply add a new task file to gulp/tasks.
 *
 * This gulp setup is a modified version of the Gulp Starter Repo, which
 * can be found at https://github.com/greypants/gulp-starter.
